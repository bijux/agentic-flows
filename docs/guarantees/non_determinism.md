# Why Non-Determinism Is Allowed

- Non-determinism is expected when the determinism level declares it.
- Entropy must be declared with source and magnitude before use.
- Replay acceptability, not equality, governs evaluation for non-strict runs.
- Evidence must label its determinism status at creation time.
- Silent randomness is forbidden and treated as a semantic violation.

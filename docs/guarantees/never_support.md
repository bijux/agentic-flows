# What We Will Never Support

- Undeclared non-determinism that bypasses determinism level or entropy policy.
- Silent overrides that alter execution without an explicit trace event.
- Unverifiable reasoning that bypasses evidence and verification policy.
- Best-effort execution that suppresses failures or hides partial results.
- Implicit memory that cannot be represented as an artifact or evidence.

# Documentation Policy
> Docstring and contract coverage policy.

Internal docstrings are sparse by design to avoid duplicating contract sources.
Contracts and tests are the source of truth for behavior and guarantees.
Docstring coverage percentages do not reflect correctness or safety here.
We prioritize enforceable contracts over narrative documentation.

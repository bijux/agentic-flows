## Who This Is For  
- Researchers who need deterministic, replayable execution.  
- Platform teams enforcing audit-ready agent workflows.  
- Operators who must explain why runs diverged.  

## Who This Is Not For  
- Teams looking for a general chat framework.  
- Product builders optimizing for rapid prototyping over rigor.  
- Users who want silent retries or hidden randomness.  

## Warning  
If you want a forgiving system that hides nondeterminism, this will feel strict and slow. That is intentional.

# v0.1.0 Release Notes

## What it is
- A governed execution and replay substrate with auditable non-determinism controls.
- A contract-first system with schema-defined surfaces and traceable run data.

## What it is not
- A stability promise or backward compatible API line.
- A mature probabilistic reasoning framework.

## Who it is for
- Engineers and researchers who need reproducible execution, replay analysis, and audit trails.
- Teams validating agent workflows under explicit determinism and entropy constraints.

## What comes next
- Stabilization of runtime enforcement and replay semantics.
- Narrow, test-backed surface expansions aligned with schema guarantees.

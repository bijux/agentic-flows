# What This Is Not

This project is deliberately narrow. It exists to define deterministic execution and replay contracts, not to become a general-purpose agent platform.

- It is not an agent runtime.
- It is not a planner.
- It is not a chat framework.

If you need any of the above, you should use or build a system that is designed for those responsibilities.
